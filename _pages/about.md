I’m a PhD student at Instituto Superior Técnico (IST), Lisbon, advised by [André Martins](https://andre-martins.github.io).
Previously, I obtained my MSc degree in Aerospace Engineering at IST and spent one semester at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras in Chennai, India. 
My research interests are centered around Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.
